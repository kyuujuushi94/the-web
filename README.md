# zeeZi-arg
 site server for the zeezi arg
## Note:
Since this is a repository to hold fictional sites, I am not responsible
for the fact that some kids might think this shit is real. Believe me, I was
that kid that got intoduced to args like Marble Hornets and thought, "Oh shit!
this is soooooo real and spooky I should believe it!" so I do not recommend this
arg to anyone younger than 13. Ideal age is 15 and older since that's when we
start thinking straight (or not :P) mainly because there is some dark and fucked
up shit in here i.e.: The Church of Suicide and the fact that there's a shady
biotech company that does human experiments and one of the characters had to
deal with them.

## Any clues for me to see here?
Nope not at the moment. As I'm writing this readme file I just finished putting
spYdr's first few html code for the home page.
